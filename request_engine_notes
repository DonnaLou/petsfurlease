Request engine:

Plaintext description:

A pet owner should be able to request that a particular sitter watch their pet. To this, the would go to a particular profile's info page and initiate a request.
This will take the owner to a page where they can leave a message or any details and submit a request. From here the owner is redirected to a confirmation page.
On the sitter's side, when the owner submits a request, the engine sends the sitter an email. This email includes a link to the sitter's Requests page.
The sitter can either confirm or deny the request here or go into the actual request to view details. If the sitter denies the request, the request is removed from
the sitter's request queue and an email is sent to the pet owner confirming the denial of the request. If the sitter accepts the request, the owner is sent an email
acknowledging the acceptance of the request. This email includes the sitter's phone number and email address. At this point, the exchange is out of PFL's hands.

(bonus)
A pet owner can request that multiple sitters watch their pet -
  they should be able to set certain criteria to match potential sitters against (rating, most watched pet types, etc)
